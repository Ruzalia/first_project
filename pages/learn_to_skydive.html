			<p class="block_name">Tandem Skydive</p>
			<p>With no previous experience, and just a few minutes of training, you can leap out of a plane and soar with the wind in your face over the ground! You will be harnessed to someone who does this for a living.</p>

<p>A tandem skydive is the perfect way to enjoy the thrill of free fall and a canopy flight with the comfort of having our qualified Tandem Instructors look after of the rest of the details. All training, (and any reassurances required!), will be provided by our friendly ground staff. Required clothing will be provided depending on the time of the year.</p>

<p>Free fall is the ultimate opportunity to experience an exhilarating adrenaline rush. From our jump altitude you will definitely feel the air rushing past your body as you reach speeds of up to 220km/hr (136mi/hr).</p>

<p>The rapid deceleration as the parachute opens and inflates is a surprisingly smooth transition to a peaceful canopy flight. You will now actually be able to concentrate on the spectacular scenery from the most incredible birds eye view as you fly back down to earth. </p>
<p class="block_name">Static-line Student Skydiving</p>
			<p>Our USPA-approved, Solo First-Jump Course is your first step in becoming a licensed skydiver. The first-jump course encompasses all of the training necessary to undertake your first solo skydive. The course lasts around 6 to 7 hours, and consists of classroom instruction and developing practical skills. Аfter which you’ll be ready to make your very first skydive (weather permitting).</p>

<p>To streamline the training process and maximize efficiency, your first solo jump will be a static-line jump from 3,500 ft. above the ground. During a static-line jump, your parachute is deployed automatically after you exit the aircraft. Training is focused on a stable body position, canopy flight, and landing. An instructor rides with you in the aircraft to ensure you exit safely, but you are solo – wearing your own individual parachute system and not connected to an instructor. After you exit the airplane, another instructor on the ground will assist you in landing, using a hand-held radio.</p>
