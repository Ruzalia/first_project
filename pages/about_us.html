			<p>

Tandem skydiving is unquestionably the safest way to experience skydiving for the first time. While there are inherent associated risks, it is statistically a lot safer than you may think. According to the National Safety Council, a person is much more likely to be killed getting struck by lightning or stung by a bee.<br/>

Our experienced and professional Tandem Instructors are USPA qualified and have completed thousands of jumps in varying conditions. They will as a priority make your jump safe, but will also make your first skydiving experiences memorable and fun!<br/>

Our equipment, parachutes, harnesses and clothing are state of the art and of the highest quality. All tandem rigs are equipped with reserve canopies and Automatic Activation Devices (AAD) which will deploy the parachute in the unlikely event of an emergency situation.<br/>

Inclement weather conditions including extensive cloud and/or strong winds – management reserves the right to cancel operations for safety reasons.<br/>
<p class="block_name">Skydive center is a club operating out of the airfield <q>Korotich</q>.</p> We have been in operation since 1987.<br/>

We offer tandem skydives, demonstration jumps, and we can teach you to become a skydiver through our USPA approved Static Line Student Training Programs.
<p class="block_name">Aircrafts</p>
We operate two aircrafts:<br/>
<ul>

<li>a Super Cessna 182 which can take 4 skydivers to 12,000 feet in just over 15 minutes;</li>
<li>a Cessna 206 which can take 5 skydivers to 10,000 ft. in around 20 minutes.</li></ul></p>
